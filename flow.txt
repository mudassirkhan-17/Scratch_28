first indicators file, input files, comparision,
then we create strategy.py --> which will contain usage of functions etc
strategy.py --> get_inputs() --> download_data() --> after we got data we make dataframe containing
indicators --> calculate_indicators() --> now we got indciator we have to see how much to shift column
i.e candle comparision --> generate_signals() --> they generate signals and give dataframe with entry/exit
--> entry long()  -> entry short () --> formula mentioned below. --> get_strategy_direction() --> to
ask wether to long or short --> execute_reversal_strategy() --> now we got everything so far. -->
we added three files. --> portfoliomanager, risk manager, trade executor. refer pt1 for reference








initial cash = 100
invested_amount = initial cash * 0.8
buying price = no of shares * price
remaining = invested_amount - buying price  
final cash = 0
sellingprice = no of shares * price

so i asked gpt to wrote sl/tp formula and what it meniton was if tp/sl hit then close the trade instead 
of signals which is wrong

pt1.

portfoliomanager:
enter_long_position(self, current_price) --> calculate variables only [shares,moneyspent,remaining]
exit_long_position(self, current_price) --> same --> 'shares','selling_price', profit_loss,'final_cash'--> reset variables as well

enter_short_position(self, current_price):
exit_short_position(self, current_price): --> shares are in positive btw

get_portfolio_value(self, current_price): --> end portfolio value after selling, we corrected the short logic

get_position_value(self, current_price): --> get current value

reset_for_next_trade(self, new_cash): --> make everything nulll

is_long,short,flat()

get_position_info() --> curent portoflio etc. 

calculate_total_return(self):--> initial cash, final value, total profit, total return percent
